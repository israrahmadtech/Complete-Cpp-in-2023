/*
Difference between Programing and Coding:
PROGRAMMING: In Programing we think how to solve a problem.
--> Solving a problem without implementing on computer called Programming.
--> All of our logic, working and solution is required in programming.
&
CONDING: In Coding we think how  to implement the problem in computer.
--> Implementation/running of a problem in computer called Coding.(just typing of program)
--> Just to understand the system and execution of program

TYPES OF LANGUAGES:
1) STATICALLY TYPED PROGRAMING LANGUAGE:
The language which force the user to define DATA TYPE before initializing of a VARIABLE.
--> Defining Data type is must.
e.g --> C, C++, JAVA.

2) DYNAMICALLY TYPED PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE:
The languages in which the Data Type is not compulsory and its optional.
--> Defining Data type is not required(It will work if you define or not)
e.g --> Python, JavaScript.

PROGRAM DEBUGGING:
    After writing the program, the next step is to debug the program
    (Debug means to correct the faults present in program).
ERRORS:
i) Syntax error: Syntax errors occurs when we violate(not follow) any gramatical rules of programming language.
e.g --> Leaving (,  ;   :   etc) during coding.

ii) Run Time error: The error that causes abnormal termination during execution.
--> It abonormal(not work properly) the program during execution/running.
int a=5/0; --> This is a Run Time error

iii) Logical error: It is simply an incorrect translation of either the problem statement or the algorithm.
--> Either the problem statement is false.
--> or the algorithm we followed is false.
--> Program will run but the result will incorrect.
Presedence --> x = -b +- sqrt(b*b-4*a*c)/ (2*a)
