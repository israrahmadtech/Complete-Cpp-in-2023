// std(standard namespace) is a namespace 
// :: this sign is called resolution of scope (:: is an operator)
// << this is called insertion (used with cout)
// >> this is called extraction  (used with cin)
// cout  used for taking output from program OR use to get output (used for printing)
// cin   used to give input to computer
// cin and cout are collectively called object (they are a part of object)
