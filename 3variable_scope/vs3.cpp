// Variable: Container to store your data (it holds data)
int x= 4; // means that x is an integer variable which holds 4.

// Variable Scope:
// the rigion where the variable is exist/present
// types:

// 2) Global Variable Scope:
// Varibles that are declared outside the function and can be access from avery where.

// 1) Local Variable Scope:
// Varibles that are declared inside the braces{} of any function and can be access from this function only.

// global variable will not execute if local variable is available
// we can guve same name to local and global variable but local variable will be executed
