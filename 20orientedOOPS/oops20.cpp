/*
*************  Procedure Oriented Programing (POP)  *************
1) Consist of writing a set of instructions for the computer to follow
2) Main focus is on function not on flow of Data
3) Function can use Either local or global data
4) Data moves openly from function to function

*************  Object Oriented Programing (OOP)     **************
DEFINATION: OOP is a programming approuch that are based on classes and objects, which can
            contain data and code that manipulate(manage) that data.
2) Works on the concept of classes and objects
3) A class is a template to create object
4) Treats the Data as a critical element     (Applying restrictions on data)
5) Decomposes the problems in object and builds data and functions arround the objects

******** Basic concepts in Object Oriented Programing (OOP) *********
CLASS  : Basic template for creating objects.
OBJECT : Basic run time entities.
Data Abstraction and Encapsulation(make capsule of data(adding data into capsule)(making a unit/class)) : Wraping data and function into single units.
Inheritance : Properties of one class can be inheritant into others.
Polymorphism : Ability to take more then one forms.
Dynamic Binding : Code which will execute, will not known until the program runs.
Message Passing : Object.message(information) call formate.

********** Benefits of Object Oriented Programing (OOP) *************
Better code reusabilty using objects and inheretance.
Principle of data hiding build hepls secure systems.
Multiple Objects can co-exist without any interference.
Software complexity can be managed easity.
